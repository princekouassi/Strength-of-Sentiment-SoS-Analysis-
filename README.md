# Strength of Sentiment (SoS) Analysis

## Main Aim:
Attempt at gauging sentiment strength by including RT data! This is an ongoing project.

There is a world of reaction time data that is either ignored or misused. Literature has
continously shown the significant insights it yeilds. However, I am not convinced that it is
being used to its full potentional, or used at all in the non-academic areas of sentiment analysis.

This project will largely be coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for now.

## Want to Get Involved?
Feel free to reach out to me if you wish to get involved in this project, or if you want
to discuss applying this analysis to a specific dataset you have in mind.
